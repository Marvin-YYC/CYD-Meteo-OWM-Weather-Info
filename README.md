**CYD (Cheap Yellow Display)** Meteo Weather Information Aggregator
Original code and assistance from  https://github.com/marcosjl31 with many thanks
https://github.com/marcosjl31/WeatherStation

This particular PIO code is set up to run on **CYD** ESP32-**2432s028** (the one with the single micro usb)
I believe  it will run on other CYD's with some configuration  changes

This is a work in progress, any help or suggestions will be greatly appreciated.  
I am not using the weather icons in my code, as they used too much realestate for my application.  I left them in the sketch in the event I figure out how to use them, or if someone else wants to use them.  I have also added a weather icon font for future use.  The weather icon (from the font) in the top right corner is just for show at the moment.  I am also hoping to add AQHI data once I figure that out.  :)
